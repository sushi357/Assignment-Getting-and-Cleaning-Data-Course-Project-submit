The following transformations were performed on the input data to produce the output data. The script:

-loads the data set “train.txt” from its directory 

-labels the variable names in the “train.txt” data set to correspond to the descriptive variable names contained in "features.txt"

-adds the “activity” and “subject” variables contained in "y_train.txt" and “subject_train.txt”, respectively, to the “train.txt” data set

-the entries in the “activity” variable are converted from a numeric value to a descriptive character value according to the conversion contained in the “activity_labels” document

-the same above-mentioned steps are performed on the “test.txt” data set

-the “train.txt” and “test.txt” data sets are combined into a single data set

-a subset of the combined data set is taken containing only those variables that are a mean or standard deviation of a measurement

-the average of each remaining variable is calculated for each test subject and each activity level

-a new data frame is produced containing the averages of each variable for each test subject and each activity level
this data frame is output as .txt table

The variables in the output are: 

"1" "subject" 

IS THE NUMBER OF THE TEST SUBJECT. THIS RANGES FROM 1-30

"2" "activity" 

IS THE ACTIVITY OF THE TEST SUBJECT. POSSIBLE VALUES ARE: 
	-"WALKING"
 	-"WALKING_UPSTAIRS"
	-"WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS"
 	-"SITTING"
 	-"STANDING"
	-"LAYING"

THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES CONTAIN EITHER THE WORD “Acc”, “Gyro” OR “angle”:

	Acc: THE ACCELERATION SIGNAL FROM THE SMART PHONE ACCELEROMETER IN STANDARD GRAVITY UNITS 'g' 
	Gyro: THE ANGULAR VELOCITY VECTOR MEASURED BY THE SMART PHONE GYROSCOPE 
	Angle: THE ANGLE MEASURED BY THE SMART PHONE GYROSCOPE IN RADIANS 

VARIABLES WITH mean() IN THEIR NAME CORRESPOND TO AVERAGES OF 3 DIMENTIONAL SIGNALS RECORDED BY THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S II. 

VARIABLES WITH std() IN THEIR NAME CORRESPOND TO THE STANDARD DEVIATIONS OF 3 DIMENTIONAL SIGNALS RECORDED BY THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S II.
